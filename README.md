# docker-php-mysql-stack
Simple developer environment that includes PHP, MySQL and phpMyAdmin.
By default includes a PHP 5.6 that I used to work with legacy code, but easily PHP 7 could be run in this configuration.

# Usage

Clone this repository inside of you'r project's directory, and run `sudo docker-compose up`
